This is my first prgram uploaded on GitHub.

The methods used above are methods we use when we have some initial conditions or only some boundary conditions(like we get to see in most physical phenomena,eg. the path of a comet, asteroid or celestial body).
So i hope that everyone who sees this gets some comprehensions on why we need these methods.
